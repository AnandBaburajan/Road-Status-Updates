Road status updates during the Kerala Floods
=================

A tool to check whether roads are okay or not during the Kerala Floods. It lets people select two locations and check the status of the road connecting them. If urgent, people can enquire for the status of particular roads and the enquiry will be shown in the enquiries page.

People with information can answer the enquiries and update the status of the roads along with the date/time and remarks. A quick overview of affected roads is also provided.
